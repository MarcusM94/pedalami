# About our project
The aim of the PedalaMi project is a simple and user-friendly design as well as to offer the best
possible user experience while cycling in a city. This project promotes the use of bikes as a green and
sustainable alternative to non-zero-emission vehicles, which still are the most preferred choice in the
field. This is achieved by providing users with an interactive system that facilitates cycling, thanks to
a fun reward and challenge-based system to enrich the standard riding experience, making it more
attractive to everyday cyclists.
